<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>In September 2012, we announced that OPOSOD had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better OPOSOD for you. Since then, we&#39;ve been collaborating with Facebook&#39;s team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we&#39;ve learned that by being able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users.</p>

<p>We&#39;re updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your OPOSOD photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we&#39;re looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren&#39;t changing the core features of the app that you&#39;ve come to know and love.</p>

<p>Our new Privacy Policy is effective on June 19, 2017.</p>

<p>Effective date: June 19, 2017</p>

<p>Welcome to OPOSOD. OPOSOD provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for you to share media through our content-sharing platform. 
User can upload one photo at any day.</p>
